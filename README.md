# Fictif

Create random fictive people or some of their informations to use as fake data.

## Use Only The Classes

In order to generate what you want, into the more simple way, I have design this library into several small parts. So, if you want only generate fake passwordq, you can.

### Birthday Class
TODO

### Email Class
TODO

### FirstName and LastName Classes
TODO

### Login Class
TODO

### Password Class
TODO

### Putting it all together: The User Class
TODO

## Use The CLI App

Before using the CLI app, be sure you have PHP CLI installed on your system, and then, go to the root projects to execute this:

```
composer install
```

After that, you can do a simple `php fictif.php` to have the list of all available options.

Try it, you can output result as __JSON__, __serialized PHP__ or __CSV__.
